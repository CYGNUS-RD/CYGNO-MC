Guide to /CYGNO Commands in the CYGNO geant4 simulation CYGNOMC

All commands begin with /CYGNO (main directory)

*********************************************************************

/CYGNO/lab/   Control commands for laboratory:

 *) /CYGNO/lab/select
	
	Description: Select the CYGNO laboratory geometry. 

	Guidance: Possible choices are LNGS or NoCave. LNGS corresponds to the default laboratory geometry setup from LNGS. NoCave simply replace the cave with a box of air.

***********************************************************************

/CYGNO/shield/   Control commands for shield:

 *) /CYGNO/shield/select 

	Description: Select the CYGNO shielding geometry. 

	Guidance: Possible choices are FullShield or NoShield. Full corresponds to a shielding made of 4 nested boxes around the AirBox that contains the vessel. NoShield corresponds to a box made of Air. 

 The following commands are valid for the shield option "FullShield" only.

 *) /CYGNO/shield/thick0 

	Description: Set thickness for shield layer #0; layers are numbered from 0 to 3, #0 being the outermost

	Guidance: Give a number and the relative unit.

	Ex. /CYGNO/shield/thick0 10. cm

 *) /CYGNO/shield/thick1 

	Description: Set thickness for shield layer #1; layers are numbered from 0 to 3, #0 being the outermost

	Guidance: see above

 *) /CYGNO/shield/thick2

	Description: Set thickness for shield layer #2; layers are numbered from 0 to 3, #0 being the outermost

	Guidance: see above

 *) /CYGNO/shield/thick3 

	Description: Set thickness for shield layer #3; layers are numbered from 0 to 3, #0 being the outermost

	Guidance: see above

 *) /CYGNO/shield/mat0 

	Description: Set material of the CYGNO shield layer #0. 

	Guidance: Possible candidates are Pb, PE, Cu, Air, Water

 *) /CYGNO/shield/mat1 

	Description: Set material of the CYGNO shield layer #1. 

	Guidance: see above

 *) /CYGNO/shield/mat2 

	Description: Set material of the CYGNO shield layer #2. 

	Guidance: see above

 *) /CYGNO/shield/mat3 

	Description: Set material of the CYGNO shield layer #3. 

	Guidance: see above

*******************************************************************************************

/CYGNO/gas/   Control commands for the gas:

 *) /CYGNO/gas/frac_He 

	Description: Set the fraction of He in the CYGNO gas.  

	Guidance: Fractions normalized to 1, corresponding to gas at 1 atm pressure. The gas is made of He and CF4.

 *) /CYGNO/gas/frac_CF4 
	
        Description: Set the fraction of CF4 in the CYGNO gas.  

	Guidance: See above.


********************************************************************************************

Other Commands : 

 *) /CYGNO/updateGeo 

	Description: Update detector geometry after settings

 *) /CYGNO/outfile 

	Description: Set the output file name 

	Guidance: the name should be provided without extension.

	Ex. /CYGNO/outfile pippo will open an output file pippo.root

 *) /CYGNO/cutoutfile   

	Description: Set which events are saved into the output file. 

	Guidance: If 0 saves all events; if 1 (default) saves only events with energy released in the sensitive gas

 *) /CYGNO/save_hits_branches 

	Description: Establish if the tree branches containing the hits information for each event are saved

	Guidance: If 1 saves the above data; if 0 does not (default).

 *) /CYGNO/reportingfrequency 

	Description: Set the reporting frequency

	Guidance: If a number N is given, a printout is issued every N events.
